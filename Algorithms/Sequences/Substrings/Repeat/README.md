> Longest repeated substring will end at the internal node which is farthest from the root (i.e. deepest node in the tree), because length of substring is the path label length from root to that internal node. So finding longest repeated substring boils down to finding the deepest node in suffix tree and then get the path label from root to that deepest internal node.
